The Arduino code implements a door locking system with a keypad and servo motor. 
Users enter a four-digit password, receiving visual feedback on an LCD screen.
Correct entry activates the servo motor for temporary door unlocking.
Security features include a limited number of incorrect attempts before a temporary lockout. 
The code is well-structured for clarity and flexibility, enabling easy understanding and potential updates. 
In summary, it provides a concise and effective solution for a secure and user-friendly door locking mechanism using Arduino.
